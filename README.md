# Text Autocomplete System (C++)

## Overview
A console-based text autocomplete system implemented using the **Trie Data Structure**.  
When a user enters a prefix, the program suggests all words beginning with that prefix.  

This project demonstrates the use of advanced data structures and algorithms in real-world applications.

## Features
- Efficient prefix search using Trie
- Supports multiple word insertions
- O(L) search time per query (L = length of the prefix)
- Loads words automatically from `dictionary.txt`
- Easy to extend by adding more words to the dictionary

---

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++
- Data Structure: Trie
- File Handling for loading dictionary
